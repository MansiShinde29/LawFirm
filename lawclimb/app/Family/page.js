                            In India, civil law is primarily governed by statutes and codified laws, influenced by English common law and also traditional Hindu, Islamic, and other local customs. Here are some key aspects of civil law in India:
                            Indian Contract Act, 1872: This Act governs contracts in India, defining the rights and obligations of parties entering into contracts, and provides remedies for breach of contract.
                            Indian Sale of Goods Act, 1930: This Act regulates the sale of goods, including their warranties, conditions, and remedies for breach of contract of sale.
                            Transfer of Property Act, 1882: This Act governs the transfer of property in India, including sale, mortgage, lease, and gift of immovable property. It also includes provisions related to rights and liabilities of lessor and lessee.
                            Specific Relief Act, 1963: This Act provides for specific remedies in civil matters, such as injunctions, specific performance of contracts, and rectification of instruments.
                            Indian Succession Act, 1925: This Act deals with the succession and inheritance of property, both movable and immovable, and the legal procedure for obtaining probate and letters of administration.
                            Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: The CPC lays down the procedural rules for civil litigation in India, including jurisdiction of courts, pleadings, evidence, judgments, and execution of decrees.
                            Limitation Act, 1963: This Act prescribes the time limit within which civil suits can be filed in various matters, including recovery of debt, possession of property, and enforcement of rights.
                            Family Laws: Family laws in India are primarily based on personal laws governing different religious communities. For example, Hindu law is governed by Hindu Marriage Act, Hindu Succession Act, etc., while Muslim law is governed by Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937.
                            Consumer Protection Act, 2019: This Act provides for the protection of consumers' interests against unfair trade practices, defective goods, and deficient services.
                            Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996: This Act provides for the law relating to domestic and international arbitration and enforcement of arbitral awards in India
                            Indian Evidence Act, 1872: This Act deals with the rules of evidence in civil and criminal proceedings, including relevancy, admissibility, and weight of evidence.
                            These are some of the key legislations governing civil law in India. Additionally, judicial precedents set by various courts, including the Supreme Court of India, also play a significant role in shaping civil law jurisprudence in the country.
